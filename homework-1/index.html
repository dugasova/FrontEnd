        <p class="acquint-motivation"> A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites
            and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with.
            That's what attracts me. Front-end developers create the user interface (UI)
            that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look. It's really creative
            profession,
            but with the rules. I like rules. A career as a front-end web developer will help me unleash creativity.
            It's opportunities to work remotely. Being a front-end developer can mean being able to work for companies
            across
            the country—or even the globe—from the comfort of your. Also the opportunity to work with creative
            smart people in the same team.
            This is a huge growing area in which specialists are always needed.
            Front-end development is a career that is expected to continue being in demand for years to come.
            The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that web developer jobs in the US should grow by 13 percent from
            2020 to 2030,
            which is well above the overall average of 8 percent for all jobs. 
            I hope I'll find my place in this sphere.
